# Artificial-reverberation

Reverberation is the acoustical phenomenon of sound decay, which is usually created when multiple sound waves reflect from objects and surfaces in the proximity. The sound waves interfere with each other and create an echo-like effect. In this project, a Feedback Delay Network is used to create an artificial reverberation.
